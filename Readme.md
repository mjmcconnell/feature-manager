# Feature Manager

This project is setup as a sample project of golang based architecture rather than an actual application purpose.

## Local development

### Native

#### Server

To start the local dev server from your local environment;

    $ cd server && make run

#### UI

### Docker

With [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed, you can get started by running:

    $ docker-compose up

### Running

Once the local development environment is up and running, you should be able to navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser to see the API running

The project uses [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) to support live-reloading of the server as you develop
